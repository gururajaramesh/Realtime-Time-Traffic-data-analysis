# Realtime-Time-Traffic-data-analysis
Bosch ConnectedExperience (BCX) is one the Europe's largest hackathon with more than 700 participants organised by Bosch in Berlin. There were 5 hack challenges such as Mobility, Manufacturing, Buildings, Utility Cross Domain and Social Impact. I was part of the Mobility stream and I was involved in a project called "Intelligent Traffic Control system". We built a machine learning based decision making model to manage traffic. We used image data to calculate the traffic density and intelligently decide which lane gets the green signal.
