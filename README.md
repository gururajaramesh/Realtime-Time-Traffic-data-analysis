This project was done as part of the Bosch ConnectedExperience (BCX) Hackathon conducted by Bosch in Berlin.

# Realtime-Time-Traffic-data-analysis
Bosch ConnectedExperience (BCX) is one the Europe's largest hackathon with more than 700 participants organised by Bosch in Berlin. There were 5 hack challenges such as Mobility, Manufacturing, Buildings, Utility Cross Domain and Social Impact.
This project was done as a part of the Mobility Stream.

## Project Description
The project is called "Intelligent Traffic Control system". We built a machine learning based decision making model to manage traffic. We used image data to calculate the traffic density and intelligently decide which lane gets the green signal.

## Key Concepts used for the project
* Yolov3
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Transfer Learning

## Libraries Used
* Keras Functional API
* Streamr API
* Bosch IOT Suite
* Numpy
* other common Deep learning libraries
